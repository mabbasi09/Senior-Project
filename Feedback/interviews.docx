I was able to get 2 interviews for this project, I asked them both the same questions.  I interviewed two of my friends, one was a former Point Park Student that transferred, and both are current students at CCAC.  The first interview was with Tim Loper, the former PPU student, and one was with Mike Wagner, a freshman.
  


What would you look for in a student scheduler app?  One that allows you to register for your courses?


Tim: “I never really put too much thought into course registration, but one thing I think that would be cool is if you could combine both the registration and the course recommendations into one.  I usually have to see what courses I need to take on something separate, and then go to a different page and register.  If it was a side by side kind of thing that would be helpful.”

Mike: “I would like something keeps it simple.  I want to be able to just search for a course and add it to my schedule, without having to read through a bunch of other stuff.”



Although it is not complete yet, how do you feel about the features we will be incorporating into our app?


Tim: “It seems like you have the features you need, but I would add in some more design to the application itself.  It feels too plain to have it stand out against already existing applications.”

Mike: “I can’t think of any other features besides what is there, I would just be interested to see them when they are functioning.”



Is there anything that you feel we could add to make this app stand out and more useful for the students?


Tim: “Just being able to see course recommendations and being able to register together I think is big enough.  I also  think design would be big with an application like this.  Having it stand out and representing the school that it will be used for would be nice.”

Mike: “I think something unique would be an option to directly email or contact someone from the site if you have any questions about your schedule or progress.  Besides that, making sure it is user friendly is big for me.”
