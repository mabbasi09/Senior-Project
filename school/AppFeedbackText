Javon:
Likes app, would love to see the course planner so that he doesnâ€™t take unneeded courses. Also, likes the convenience of doing it on your own without making appointment, signing papers, meeting an advisor etc. As long as you know what other classes you need, it is simple and convenient. 
Would like to see a teacher report, to see who is teaching what class and feedback from students about teacher to better enhance curriculum and meet student needs. Similar to ratemyprofessor.com

Asif:
Likes the features in the app such as the ability to view upcoming courses required and track your degree progress. Thinks a mobile version would be a good idea. Also thinks it would be good to have a version for each major for undecided students who want to compare major class requirements.
